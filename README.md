# README

Welcome to My Rails Final Project!

    1. To get started, make sure to run 'rake db:migrate' as well as 'rake db:seed' if you want to seed the database with dummy data.

    2. Head to 'users/sign_up' to create your first account! 
        *Note that your username cannot be changed once submitted. But you may change your display name.

    3. You may also sign up through Facebook using the 'Sign Up With Facebook' link.

    4. When you head to your profile, you will notice that you have no followers nor are you following anyone! Click the 'following' 
    link to view all users that you can follow.

    5. Next, head to the 'Your Groups' tab to see you don't belong to any groups nor created your own. Hit the 'Create New Group' link 
    to start your very first group!

    6. When you create your own group, you are automatically made the moderator of the group. Don't forget to set your status whenever you first join a group!

    7. You will have the option to invite new members to the group. 
        *Note that when you invite someone, they have the option to accept or decline it. And, when a user has a pending invitation, they have access to view posts and other users in the group. They do not have permission to create posts, likes, comments until they confirm their subscription.
